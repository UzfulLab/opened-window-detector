###Dependencies:
In order to make it work you will have to add these two libraries :
 * [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2)
 * [RF24](https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24)

### Want to make your own ?
I wrote an [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Opened-Window-Detector/) that recaps all steps to make your own, don't hesitate to leave a comment there if you have any ideas of improvement or request :)
