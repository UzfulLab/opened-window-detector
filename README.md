# opened window detector

This project is a opened window detector solution, based on arduino board and RF24 communication module.

###Dependencies:
In order to make it work you will have to add these two libraries :
 * [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2)
 * [RF24](https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24)

### Want to your own ?
